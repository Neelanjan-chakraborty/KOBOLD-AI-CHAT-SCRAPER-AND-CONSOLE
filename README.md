# 💬🤖KOBOLD AI : CHAT SCRAPER AND CONSOLE 💬🤖
The purpose of this project is to create an interface for communicating with the Kobold AI website, whether it's running locally or on Colab version. 🌐 Please note that it does not work on the website version, but you can change the code to make it work with the version. However, it may be slow. 🐢 The scraper can successfully communicate with the server, provided that you have already done the necessary changes in the server, such as loading the AI model and setting up the chat. 💬

## 💻 Steps to Configure: 💻
- Start the server or the Colab Notebook that has the kobald AI -link in it.
- Wait for it to show the link and once the link is shown, copy it.
- Go to a browser, bypass the tunnel website, and set up the AI like adding a model and loading the past chat. It's required that you are already accustomed to the Kobold AI interface.
- Now run the chatbot_scraper, and when it asks for the URL, copy and paste the URL you copied.
- Setup the Name of the Bot, it's important that the name should match with that of the bot, example (Alexa:).
The app should then work perfectly.
## 🐛 Known Bugs: 🐛
- There is a bug at the starting of the chat, but it's ignorable.
- The chatbot might not repeat a few words if it has already said them earlier.
- The chatbot is not perfect, but it works.
## 🛠️ If You Want to Modify: 🛠️
Feel free to do so and please mention a link or src to my GitHub repo. This is an open-source project under a standard license.

## 🚀 Future Plans: 🚀
- Develop a FrontEnd GUI for this App.🎨
- A website Interface for this app.🌐
- API to communicate with your favorite Chat App.
