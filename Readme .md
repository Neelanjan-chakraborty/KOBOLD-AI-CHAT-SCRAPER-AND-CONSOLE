🤖📟 KOBOLD AI: CHAT SCRAPER AND CONSOLE 📟🤖

The purpose of this project is to provide an interface to communicate with the Kobold AI website, either running locally or on Colab version. Please note that it doesn't work on the website version, but you can modify the code to make it work with that version, although it will be slow. The scraper can successfully communicate with the server provided you have already made the necessary changes in the server, such as loading AI models and setting up the chat.

🛠️ Steps to Configure:

Start the server or Colab Notebook that has the Kobold AI link in it.
Wait for it to show the link and once the link is shown, copy it.
Go to a browser, bypass the tunnel website and set up the AI, like adding a model and loading the past chat. It's required that you are already accustomed to the Kobold AI interface.
Now, run the chatbot_scraper, and when it asks for the URL, copy and paste the URL you copied.
Set up the name of the bot. It's important that the name should match that of the bot. Example (Alexa:)
The app should then work perfectly.
🐞 Known Bugs:

There is a bug at the start of the chat, but it's ignorable.
The chatbot might not repeat a few words if it has already said them earlier.
The chatbot is not perfect, but it works.
🛠️ Modification:
Feel free to modify the code and please mention a link or source to my GitHub repo. This is an open-source project under a standard license.

🚀 Future Plans:

Develop a frontend GUI for this app.
A website interface for this app.
API to communicate with your favorite chat app.
